# ThirdWay.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jbn/ThirdWay.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jbn/ThirdWay.jl)

`ThirdWay.jl` is a Julia package for building Agent-Based Models (ABMs).

This package is a work-in-progress. I'll be developing it iteratively, as I write my Ph.D. dissertation. Packages for discrete event simulation (DES) already exist (e.g. [SimJulia.jl](https://github.com/BenLauwens/SimJulia.jl)). However, I think the co-rountine style is too foreign for most computational social scientists. I want something [MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/)-like and familiar, so non-Julians can read my code.


## Contributing

I have a very good map in my head of what I need for my dissertation. Until the map in my head and code in this package sync up, my needs may not be clear. And, I won't accept a pull request if it frustrates my project. So, if you have a cool idea, open up an issue, first. I don't want anyone submitting a good PR that gets rejected because I can't use it, yet.
